# A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique 
# (no duplicate) and must be immutable (cannot be changed)
# However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

# Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like
# Union,Intersection,Symmetric difference,etc.
